6. Factorial Calculation
Problem: Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number n. The factorial of a number n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 Ã— 4 Ã— 3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1 = 120.

7. Fibonacci Sequence

The element at index 4 is: 5
The element at index 5 is: 6
The element at index 6 is: 7
The element at index 7 is: 8
The element at index 8 is: 9
The element at index 9 is: 10
```
13. Write a function to find the maximum and minimum values in an integer array.
- Example: array {7, 2, 5, 1, 9, 4}, the output will be:
```
Maximum value: 9
Minimum value: 1
```
14. Create a program to reverse an array without using any additional arrays.
15. Sum of Elements:
- Write a program that takes 10 integers as input from the user and stores them in an array. Then, calculate and print the sum of all the elements.
16. Create a program to print a checkerboard pattern using X and O characters using nested while loops. The board size should be n x n, where n is input by the user.
Example for n = 3:
```
X O X
O X O
X O X
```

```
Example Output:
* Result: 4.33
```
18. Student Grade Calculator
Objective:
Create a program that calculates the average grade of a group of students and identifies the highest and lowest grades.

Requirements:

Ask the user to input the number of students.
Use an array to store the grades of the students.
Calculate and display the following:
- Average grade. **Average = NumberÂ ofÂ Students/SumÂ ofÂ Grades**
- Highest grade. **Eg: HighestÂ Grade=max(85,90,78)=90**
- Lowest grade. **Eg: LowestÂ Grade=min(85,90,78)=78**

19. Transpose of a Matrix
Write a program to find the transpose of a 2x3 matrix. The program should read the elements of the matrix from the user, compute the transpose, and display the transposed matrix.
Exmaple:
```
Input.
Enter elements of Matrix (2x3):
1 2 3
4 5 6

Output.
Transpose of the Matrix:
1 4
2 5
3 6
```
20. Create an array of 10 integers and the multiplication table of 5 in it.
```
Output should be: 
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45

ID: 102
City: Los Angeles
Pincode: 90001

Employee Details:
Name: John Doe
ID: 101

```
The model name: Toyota Corolla
The year of launch: 2015
The price: $15000.20

The model name: Honda Civic
The year of launch: 2020
The price: $20000.20
```
26. Simple Text Writer:
Write a C program that prompts the user to enter a string and writes that string into a file named output.txt. If the file already exists, it should be overwritten.

27. Save User Input:

```
Name: [user name]
Age: [user age]
Email: [user email]
```
28. File Logger:
Write a C program that logs the current date and time into a file named log.txt every time the program runs. If the file exists, it should overwrite the old log with the new one.
